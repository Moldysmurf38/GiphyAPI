# **Giphy API:**

### **Project Description:**

A webpage that uses an api to pull gifs from one of the preselected anime titles. A user can also select their own topic to pull gifs for.

### **Getting Started:**

Check out the Gitpages deployed version here: https://moldysmurf38.github.io/GiphyAPI/

### **How to Use:**

At the top of the page, there is a list of buttons with topics (4 anime titles by default). The user can click on a button to generate gifs on the webpage related to the topic of the button. In the event the user wishes to add their own topics to the list, they can type a subject into the text field, click the add topic button, and finally click on the newly created button to display the new category of gifs. All newly rendered gifs are static and require the user to click on them to animate or freeze each gif as the user wishes.

### **Prerequisites:**

None.

### **Installing:**

If you wish to use the files locally, clone the repository's master branch onto your computer. After the clone is complete, open the index.html file in your browser.
